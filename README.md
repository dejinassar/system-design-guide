Guide Overview
The guide is broken down into easy-to-digest sections that build on each other.

1. Introduction to System Design
Defines system design and outlines the core questions to ask when approaching a new problem. This section differentiates between High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD).

2. Key Concepts
This section covers the building blocks of scalable systems. You'll learn about:

Scalability: Vertical vs. Horizontal scaling.

Load Balancing: Distributing traffic to prevent server overload.

Caching: Storing frequently accessed data for fast retrieval.

CAP Theorem: The trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

3. Core Components of a System
A breakdown of the essential components found in most modern systems, including API layers, databases, message queues, and CDNs. A simple table explains the role of each component.

4. Architecture Patterns
Learn about popular architectural styles like Monolithic and Microservices, along with their respective trade-offs and use cases.

5. Database Concepts
This section compares SQL and NoSQL databases and covers essential concepts like Sharding, Replication, and Indexing for managing data at scale.

6. Common Interview Problems
This is a practical section that provides detailed breakdowns and solutions for classic system design interview questions, such as:

URL Shortener (like Bit.ly)

Social Media Feed (like Twitter)

Messaging App (like WhatsApp)

E-commerce Platform (like Amazon)

7. Step-by-Step System Design Approach
This section provides a structured, 8-step framework for solving any system design problem in an organized and thoughtful manner.

How to Use This Guide
This guide is designed for both quick review and deep study. Feel free to read through the sections, use the Table of Contents to jump to a specific topic, and refer to the common problems section for practical examples.
